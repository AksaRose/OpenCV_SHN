# Categorizer
Its an another non-veg lunch day in the hostel and you give count to the veg option but what happens is that at the time of the lunch people shift between veg and non veg and there is a shortage of veg menu. To solve this here comes CATEGORIZER, with the help of OpenCV library it can identify whos veg and whos not by the data fed into it earlier.

## How it Works
The people who give count for the veg and non veg menu is fed into the database with their photos, using the OpenCV and Face recognition libraries, it recognises the face and identify whether the person gave count for veg or non veg.
